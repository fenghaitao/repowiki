## Overview & Architecture

### Section Overview
The "Overview & Architecture" section provides a high-level understanding of the project, its goals, and how it is structured. It includes detailed information about the project's purpose, design principles, and the architecture that supports its functionality. This section is essential for developers and stakeholders to understand the core concepts and design philosophy of the codebase.

### Table of Contents
- [Project Overview](01-overview/project-overview.md): A comprehensive summary of the project, including its purpose, key features, primary use cases, target audience, and high-level architecture.
- [Architecture](01-overview/architecture.md): An analysis of the codebase's architectural pattern, core components, and data flow.
- [Design Decisions](01-overview/design-decisions.md): Documentation on the key abstractions, design principles, and domain-specific terminology used in the codebase.
