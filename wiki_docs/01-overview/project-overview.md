## Project Overview

Repowiki is a hierarchical wiki generator designed to create comprehensive documentation for code repositories. Its primary purpose is to streamline and automate the process of generating structured, developer-friendly documentation by leveraging advanced knowledge graph techniques through the LightRAG framework. By integrating AI-powered models such as GitHub Copilot and the `gpt-4o` language model, Repowiki offers a highly efficient and scalable solution for documenting complex codebases. The tool ensures clarity, consistency, and ease of use for developers working across diverse projects.

Key features of Repowiki include the ability to index repositories into LightRAG knowledge graphs, generate hierarchical documentation with parallel processing, and customize outputs based on user-defined prompts. Its capabilities extend to creating detailed API references, dependency analyses, testing guides, and extension points, all while maintaining a high level of automation. The target audience for Repowiki includes software developers, technical writers, and project managers who require robust and dynamic documentation solutions for their code repositories. The high-level architecture of Repowiki is modular, with core components such as the Repository Indexer and WikiGenerator working in tandem to enable efficient indexing and documentation generation.
